-- Does queue imbalance predict the direction of the NEXT mid-price move?
-- (Cartea, Donnelly & Jaimungal 2018; Gould & Bonart 2016.)
--
-- For every book state we find the next event at which the mid changes and
-- record its direction (+1 up / -1 down). "Next change" is found without a
-- correlated subquery: a running count of mid changes gives each state the
-- number of the change it is waiting for.
