-- 03_time_grid.sql
-- A regular 1-second clock. Each row holds the state as of the END of that
-- second: the last mid quote and the last traded price seen so far
-- (forward-filled). Used for realized volatility and intraday patterns.
--
-- Forward fill without engine-specific IGNORE NULLS: COUNT(x) over a running
-- window only increments on non-NULL rows, so it labels each run of "x then
-- NULLs" with one group id; MAX(x) within that group fills the gap.
